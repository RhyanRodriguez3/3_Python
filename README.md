a.	BONUS Python:
i.	pandas and numpy 
ii.	Pull from an API
iii.	Web scrape with bs4 https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XVv6mJpFOb0&t=85s
iv.	web scraping football matches epl with python. 
v.	Predict football match winners with ml and python.

TOP BEGINNER PROJECTS
1.	Automate Webscraping
a.	Install library beatufiulsoup (created as folder bs4), download lxml (to parse html), and requests ()
b.	Tell Python to read or write the file from the web link.
i.	HTML has tags. You want to find the link tag and body tag, which is the table you want to scrape.
ii.	Not all html is easy to read. Youâ€™ll want to right click and Inspect the file HTML code and hover over the parts you want.
c.	Use requests to pull from the websites. 
d.	To clean the HTML file, lxml parses unnecessary html tags
e.	Test by using print after every line of code to ensure your only printing needed info. Search for all info based on html tags, python will read all the tags in a list. You create variables to find and store each tag info, then once that info is pulled you parse the strings to make it readable.
f.	Automate reading with a for loop. 
2.	Pull data from an API with Python.
a.	API is made up of call, requests, and response cycle. A request typically consists of a server endpoint URL and a request method usually through HTTP
b.	All API has a key. You must read the API documentation to properly import that data.
c.	Then you use Python Pandas to organize that data into a data frame (Columns and rows).
3.	Automate something in excel with python.
a.	
4.	Simple AI application. Create a recommendation system. Use a library called python surprise.
5.	Passion project: clone an app with a twist. Recreate Netflix.
